Gary works at the intersection of policy, philanthropy, and community investment to create systemic change. We're exploring innovative approaches to make quality childcare more accessible and affordable for working families across Colorado.",
                faqQuestion2: "How long will the pilot run?",
                faqAnswer2: "We're currently in the planning phase and are gathering input from interested employers to help shape the pilot's structure. The exact duration will depend on several factors, including available philanthropic matching funds, the number of participating employers, and the specific needs of enrolled families. We anticipate sharing more details as we finalize the program design.",
                faqQuestion3: "How many employees can my company enroll?",
                faqAnswer3: "Enrollment capacity will be determined based on input from participating companies and available philanthropic funding. We're gathering information from interested employers to understand workforce needs and will work with each pilot participant to determine appropriate enrollment levels that make sense for their organization and our matching capacity.",
                faqQuestion4: "I just filled out the form. Does that mean I'm committing to the pilot?",
                faqAnswer4: "No, filling out the interest form does not constitute a commitment. We're currently gathering information to understand employer interest and needs. Submitting the form simply indicates that you'd like to learn more and potentially be considered for participation. There will be additional conversations and a separate formal agreement process before any commitments are made.",
                faqQuestion5: "What information are you gathering at this stage?",
                faqAnswer5: "We're collecting preliminary information to help us understand employer interest, workforce sizes, and what match levels would be meaningful for potential participants. This helps us design a pilot that works for Colorado employers and their employees. We're still in the exploratory phase and welcome your input to shape the program.",
                faqQuestion6: "Is there a cost to express interest?",
                faqAnswer6: "There is no cost or obligation to express interest. We're simply gathering information at this stage to understand employer needs and gauge interest. Participating in the pilot itself would involve employer contributions as part of the shared-responsibility model, but those details will be discussed in depth before any commitments are made.",
                faqQuestion7: "What types of childcare providers are included?",
                faqAnswer7: "We're working to build a network of licensed Colorado childcare providers, including childcare centers and licensed family childcare homes.
